### Technical Questions

#### 1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?
   ###### a. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
   ###### b. If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

   I spent almost 5 hours to create and design the app.
   I already added two buttons (add to favorite & read online). If I had more time, I would make them worked out. So the user can have the access to read their favorite book online, and/or add their selected book to favorite, so thay can read it later.
   Also, I would consier adding a register and login feauters. So users can have a personalized user profile, where users can see their username, favorite books, the books they are reading and the books have been read.
   Of course, I would keep the option to use the app as a guest.


#### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

   Based on what I have done so far for this app, I did not use any new features of React 18. So almost all was same as I used before.


#### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

   I haven't had any issue in this case.


#### 4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

   There is alot of data in arrays and that find it difficult to understand which one is the right one. For example, in author, isbn and etc. So, I think it's better to use them in string instead.


#### 5. Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
